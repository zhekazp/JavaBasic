Task 1(HW1):
Write a program that swaps the elements of a one-dimensional array
from a String in reverse order. Do not use an additional array to store results.

Task 2(HW2):
Write a program that will determine how many words you entered from the console.

Task 3(HW3):
Create an array of 8 random integers from the interval [1;10]. Sort the array in descending order by any algorithm.

Task 4(HW4):
Create 2 arrays of 5 random integers from the interval [0;5] each.
Print the arrays on the screen in two separate lines.
Calculate the arithmetic mean of the elements of each array.
Report for which of the arrays this value turned out to be greater.
 (or inform that their arithmetic means are equal ).

 Task 5(HW5):
 The user must enter the size of the array from the keyboard - a natural number greater than 3.
 The number entered by the user is stored in the variable n.
 If the user entered an incorrect number, the program should ask the user to repeat the input.
 Create an array of n random integers from the segment [0;n] and display it on the screen.
 TASK - Create a second array only from the even elements of the first array, if any, and display it on the screen.
