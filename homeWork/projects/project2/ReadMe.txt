Goal: Create a comprehensive system for managing employees and departments of the company.

Tasks:

    Create classes Employee (with information about first name, last name, position and department)
    and Department (with information about the name of the department and a list of employees).
    Implement a Company class that uses a collection to store departments,
    where the key is the name of the department and the value is the Department object.
    In the Company class, implement CRUD (add, search, delete) operations for employees and departments,
    including transferring employees between departments, updating information about employees and departments,
    searching for employees by various criteria (department, position, name).
    Add functionality to display reports, for example, a list of all employees of the company,
    employees of a certain department, the number of employees in the company.
