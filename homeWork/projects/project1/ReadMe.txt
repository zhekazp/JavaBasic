The project demonstrates how use (loop, arrays, classes).

Task:
Create a TaskManager class to manage tasks.
Include a createTaskFromUserInput method that allows
the user enters data to create a new task and returns
Task object.
The Task class has the fields id, taskTitle, taskDescription, priority, status.

Methods of the TaskManager class should allow you to add a task,
change its status and get a list of tasks.

Implement a sort method that sorts tasks in order of priority, from important to easy.
If tasks are of the same priority, then in alphabetical order.

To implement the application, implement a layered approach (storing
individual elements, arrays and service functions must be implemented
separately).

 Add a printTasks method to print an array of tasks (printing one element at a time).

 Implement a TaskDemo class to demonstrate how the program works.
