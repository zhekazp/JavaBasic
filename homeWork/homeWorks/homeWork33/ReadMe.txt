Task1
Description: You need to implement a contact list management system.
Each contact is represented as a Contact object with fields name and phoneNumber.
You need to use a collection to store contacts to ensure
the uniqueness of each contact based on his name and phone number.

Task2
Description: You need to implement a product catalog management system.
Each product in the system is represented as a Product object, which contains
the fields name (product name) and price (product price). When using a collection,
you must ensure that each product is unique based on a unique product identifier (productId).
Your job is to manage products in the catalog, including adding new products,
deleting existing products, and searching for products by product ID.

Task3
Description: You need to implement a system for managing travel requests.
The system should allow you to add requests in the order they were received
until the maximum collection size (set by you) is reached,
and process these requests in the order they were received.
Each request is represented as a String, which can contain any information,
such as the type of tour or the specification of the client's request.
An important part of the task is to control the maximum size
of the collection to prevent it from overflowing.
