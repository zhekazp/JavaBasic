Generic
Task1
Create a Box class to store any objects and implement methods
get() and put() to read and write objects to the box.
Use Generics for type safety.

Write a printList method that takes a list of objects and
displays them on the screen. Use Generics to provide
type safety and the ability to transfer a list of objects of any type.

Task2
Create a Pair class with two fields - first and second, and implement
getFirst() and getSecond() methods to access these fields.
Use Generics to be able to store objects in Pairs different types.

Task3
Write a findMax method that takes an array of objects and returns
the largest of them. Use Generics to enable passing an array of objects of any type.

Task4
Create a Stack class that implements an array- or list-based stack.
Use Generics for type safety and functionality passing objects of different types onto the stack.

Task5
Write a merge method that takes two sorted lists and
returns the combined sorted list. Use Generics to provide the ability to pass lists of any type to the method.

Task6
Create an Optional class to represent a value that can absent.
Implement the isPresent(), get() and orElse() methods.
Use Generics to be able to store Optional objects different types.


Task8
Create a Map class to store key-value pairs. Implement Methods
put(), get() and remove(). Use Generics to provide
type safety and the ability to store objects of different types in Map.

Task 9
Write a sortByProperty method that takes a list of objects and
the name of the field by which you want to sort the list. Use Generics
to provide the ability to pass a list of objects of any kind to the method
type and getting the field value by name.

Optional
Task2-1
Write a method that receives a list of strings and returns
the first line in the list, if it exists, or the empty string otherwise using Optional.

Write a method that receives an Integer value and returns its double value if it is not null,
using Optional.

Write a method that gets a list of integers and
returns the sum of all numbers in a list using Optional.

Write a method that receives a String value and
returns its length if it is not null using Optional.

Write a method that receives a list of strings and returns
the first line in the list if it exists, or throws
throwing NoSuchElementException using Optional.

Collections
Task3-1
Create an ArrayList of 10 elements, sort it in ascending order and display it on the screen.

Task3-2
Create a LinkedList of 10 elements, remove elements with indices that
are stored in another collection in Set and display what remains of the List.

Task3-3
Create a HashMap where the key is an Integer and the value is its square. Display all elements of a HashMap.
Create a HashSet, add some rows to it and check if it contains a certain row.
Create a TreeMap where the key is the string and the value is its length. Display all elements of a TreeMap.

Task3-4
Create a PriorityQueue of 10 elements of type Integer,
add several elements, extract the minimum element and display.

Task3-5
Create a Stack, add several elements to it. Check whether a given element is in the collection.
If there is, then find its depth and display it on the screen.

Task3-6
Create an ArrayDeque, add several elements to it on each side,
extract elements from one of the sides and display it on the screen.

Task3-7
Create a TreeMap where the key is an Integer and the value is its factorial. Display all elements of the TreeMap.

Task3-8
Create a HashSet from several elements,
create a LinkedList from the same elements and display the LinkedList elements
in the order in which they were added.

Task3-9
Create a Student class with name and grade properties, then create an ArrayList,
fill it with several Student objects and sort the list by grade in descending order.

Task3-10
Create a TreeMap where the key is a Date object and the value is a list of strings.
Then add a few lines to the list for each date and print all display items to the console in ascending date order.

Task3-11
Create a LinkedHashSet and add several objects of the Person class to it,
which have the name and age properties.
Then iterate through all the elements of the set and output
to the console only those people whose age is less than 30 years old.

Task3-12
Create a PriorityQueue and add several elements to it that have the name and priority properties.
Then retrieve elements from the queue in order of priority and print them to the console.

Task3-13
Create a TreeSet and add several Point class objects to it that have x and y properties.
Then iterate through all the elements of the set and output to the console only those points for which x > y.

Task3-14
Create a LinkedHashMap where the key is a Time object and the value is a list of strings.
Then add a few lines to the list for each time and print all display items to the console in ascending order of time.

Task3-15
Create a HashSet and add several lines to it. Then create a second set and add to it
the same lines, but in a different order. Then print to the console only those lines that are in both sets.

Task3-16
Create a HashMap where the key is a Country object and the value is a list of strings (names of cities in this country).
Then add several cities for each country and print all countries to the console in alphabetical order.

Task3-17
Create an Employee class with name, department and salary properties, then create a TreeMap,
where the key is the department and the value is the list of employees working in this department.
Then add several employees to each department and display the average salary for each department on the console.
