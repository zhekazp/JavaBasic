Task1

Description: Given a stack of integers that needs to be sorted like this:
so that the smallest elements are at the top.
You can use an additional temporary stack,
but you shouldn't copy elements into other data structures (like arrays).
The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek and isEmpty.

Goal: Write a function that sorts a stack in ascending order
elements from top to bottom.

Task2

Description: Given a queue of integers and a number k representing the quantity
rotation operations that need to be performed on the queue.
Rotating a queue means moving the last element of the queue to the beginning.
Implement a function that modifies the queue by performing k rotations.

Goal: Write a function that takes a queue and a number k, then
performs k rotations of the queue.

Task3

Description: Implement the "Priority Queue" data structure,
which supports standard element adding and retrieving operations
element with the highest priority. The priority of each element is determined
at the time of adding to the queue.

Goal: Create a PriorityQueue class with enqueue(element, priority) methods for
adding an element with a certain priority and dequeue() which retrieves
and returns the element with the highest priority.
If two elements have the same priority, they must be processed according to
FIFO principle.
